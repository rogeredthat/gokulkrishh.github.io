# Welcome to Jekyll!

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight javascript %}
var foo = "Hello World";var foo = "Hello World";var foo = "Hello World";var foo = "Hello World";var foo = "Hello World";var foo = "Hello World";var foo = "Hello World";
alert(foo);
console.log(foo);
{% endhighlight %}
